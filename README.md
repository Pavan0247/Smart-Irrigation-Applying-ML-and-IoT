# Smart-Irrigation-Applying-ML-and-IoT
Smart irrigation systems can save water, improve crop yields, and reduce labor costs. They can also help farmers to be more sustainable by reducing their water footprint.
Machine Learning is used to predict the rainfall of the weather for every 30 minutes.
IoT(Internet of Things) is used to control the sensors using Internet and Automatically.


The main aim of this project is give water to field when it is required. To do that we use Machine Learning to predict the rainfall. Using soil moisture sensor
we get the moisture of the soil. If the soil moisture is lesser than the threshold value, then we check for the rainfall in the next 30 minutes. If there is no rain
in the next 30 minutes, then water pump is turned on to give the water. If soil moisture is lesser than the threshold value, then we check for rainfall and if 
there is rainfall in the next 30 minutes then no need to give water to field.If soil moisture is greater than the threshold value then no need of checking 
rainfall and we do not give water. 

This process is done for every 30 minutes

More about that see Project Report.
